PROJECT :
LIBRARY BOOK ALLOCATION SYSTEM 

An overview of the project

A console-based program called the Library Book Allocation System was created to digitally handle key library operations like viewing available books, giving books to patrons, returning books, computing fines, and verifying current status. Without using physical registers or manual tracking, this system aims to automate manual library operations, lower errors, increase efficiency, and give students rapid access to book information. To keep the design straightforward, well-organized, and scalable for upcoming improvements, the system employs a modular structure.
